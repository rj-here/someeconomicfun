    <h1>Some Economic Fun</h1>

        Welcome! Here, I've just made a simple site based on some concepts I've learned while studying ecnoomic concepts at university.
        Like my other sites, this will also be very simple and minimal. It is me trying to now explore and implement learnings with different ideas, so this was a great spot to start.
        The pages, covering different concepts will be here, but also in the menu, where you can also go to my personal page and access all my sites!
