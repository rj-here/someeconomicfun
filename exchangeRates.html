    <h1>Some Economic Fun</h1>
    <h2>This project was inspired by ECON 1000, and 1010 at York University based on - MicroEconomics for Life: Third Edition & MacroEconomics for Life: Third Edition, both by Avi J. Cohen & Scott A. Walla</h2>
    <h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
    <p>
        I'm sure everyone either has shopped outside their native country, or has curiously compared prices of products. What's the main thing behind this? Exchange rates.
        <br>
        This part of the site will help you get exchange rate equivalent prices, or the <strong>Purchasing Power Parity Rate</strong>
